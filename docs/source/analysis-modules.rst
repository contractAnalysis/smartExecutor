Analysis Modules
================

SmartExecutor's detection capabilities are written in modules in the `/analysis/module/modules <https://github.com/contractAnalysis/smartExecutor/tree/develop/mythril/analysis/module/modules>`_ directory. Note that SmartExecutor inherits the detection ability from Mythril and thus reuses the related `documentation from Mythril <https://mythril-classic.readthedocs.io/en/master/module-list.html>`_.
